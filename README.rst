Allows clients to control which fields will be sent in the API response, *now in a multidimensional nest of levels!*
Fields are specified in the query and separated by points determining a given depth with no limit, e.g.

.. code-block:: 

    # You want a list of users but you're only interested in the fields "email" and "username":
    
    GET /users/?fields=email,username
    
    [
      {
        "email": "bruno@gmail.com",
        "username": "bruno"
      },
      {
        "email": "endzel@gmail.com",
        "username": "endzel"
      }
    ]

    
    # You want to see every field except "id" for the specific user endzel:
    
    GET /users/2/?fields!=id
    
    {
        "username": "endzel",
        "email": "endzel@gmail.com",
        "drinks": "tea",
        "location": {
            "id": 1,
            "country_name": "Spain",
            "city": "M√°laga"
        }
    }

    
    # And, you just want to filter "username" and "city" for the "location" attribute within the user endzel:
    
    GET /users/2/?fields=username,location.city
    
    {
        "username": "endzel",
        "location": {
            "city": "M√°laga"
        }
    }

Many thanks to `Wim Glenn <https://github.com/wimglenn>`_, author of the original `DRF QueryFields repository <https://github.com/wimglenn/djangorestframework-queryfields>`_ from which this one was forked that inspired me to add my two cents!
